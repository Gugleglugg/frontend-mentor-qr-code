## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Google Fonts
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to link to Google Fonts. Also, I hope I'll stop forgetting what @media syntax looks like.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet"
          href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400..700">
```
```css
@media (min-width: 480px) {
    .card {
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px hsla(220, 15%, 55%, 0.2);
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I think I'll get Frontend Mentor Pro to get access to Figma files rather than JPG, and then I'll up my margins/padding game so much.
